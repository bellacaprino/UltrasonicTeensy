# UltrasonicTeensy
Using Teensy, Max, and an Ultrasonic Sensor to create pitch.

# Welcome!

To initialize - open the Arduino code and press the toggle within MAX. Turn MAX audio engine on, select sound in the VST.

The VST3 I used is Arturia Pigments, but you can use anything, just delete and replace with a VST within Max.

Press the button to cycle in between musical scales, and turn the dial to change FX amount.

Use your hand to control a scale quantized pitch!

Have fun! Go crazy! Its fun! :)
